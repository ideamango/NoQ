    ''' "We are changing the world with technology"- said Bill Gates,  
and Rumi said- "What you seek is seeking you!".

We, on the other hand, believed that safety and upgraded services would seek us back with advanced technology. Until we stumbled upon a quote from Arthur C. Clarke-  

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic!" 
 

That was it! Because that’s when we decided on making the move ourselves creating magic with technology and finally finding what we seek!  

Founded at the time when the world stood still due to the pandemic in early 2020, BIGPIQ was developed keeping only one thing in mind- REVIVAL! After seeing ration hoarding, long queues, full car parking, and no distancing despite the guidelines, we knew that a solution was required. Not just for us as end-users but also businesses who were incapable of meeting demands and were losing out on the opportunity while others struggled to survive!  

 Since the pandemic broke, there is loss of work, depressing news, uncertainty about the future, and monotonicity due to prolonged containment and restricted life activities have started to impact the mental health of the people. If people go out there is risk of contracting the virus. Avoiding crowded places and following suggested safety measures is the only thing people can do to bring back the life to normalcy.  

Facing the issues first-hand made it easier for us to work out a solution in the form of a mobile application and named it LESSs. Even though it is the result of long brainstorming sessions, it is worth all the pulled-out hair and sleepless nights. LESSs has the capacity to balance out the business growth opportunity in the current times and give consumers the surety of services without compromising their safety. LESSs means more Satisfaction to consumers and more Opportunity to businesses. 

LESSs is the go-to platform that ensures optimum safety for you and your family. If your mind is full of What! Why! How?! Here is what you need to know. Read complete list of benefits of LESSs.  


Note: This App is not for any commercial gain, it shall remain free as long as we can support it. We are working on a donation-based model to pay for the operational cost, through which we can continue to help our society and make it a better place for everyone.
